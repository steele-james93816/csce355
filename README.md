# csce355
Project for CSCE-355

## Currently Running:
* Simulator
* Inverse Homomorphic Image

Both Simulator and Inverse Homomorphic Image both require DFA.py because both simulatory.py and invHom.py use the DFA class to create a DFA object.

If you need to run any of them individually 
  For the Simulator:
    python3 simulatory.py (path to dfa) (path to string file)
  
  For the Inverse Homomorphic Image:
    python3 invHom.py (path to dfa) (path to hom file)
